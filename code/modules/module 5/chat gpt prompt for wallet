i want a bitcoin wallet that can be automated easily.
what this means: 
-this wallet uses bitcoinlib and python.
-this wallet does not generate public and private keys.
-this wallet displays what crypto currency the wallet is.
-this wallet references a configure file for public and private keys.
-this wallet can interact with the blockchain and send transactions.
-this wallet will display "before transaction balance: x" and the  "after transaction balance: y". 
-make it so that this wallet can be imported to other programs so that python can be used to automate transactions.
-this is all in one program
