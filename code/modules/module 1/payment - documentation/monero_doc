As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a specific Python library named monero for directly interacting with 
the Monero blockchain. However, there is a Monero Python library called monero-python. Keep in mind that the Monero ecosystem 
evolves, and it's essential to check for the latest libraries or updates.

If you're looking to create a Monero wallet address tracker, you might need to interact with a Monero node using RPC (Remote Procedure Call). 
Here's a basic example using the requests library to make RPC calls:

In this example, replace rpc_url with the endpoint of your Monero node's RPC interface, and replace tracked_address with the Monero 
address you want to monitor.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you might need to customize it based on your specific requirements and the capabilities 
of the Monero node you are connecting to. Additionally, the Monero ecosystem may have evolved, so be sure to check for any new libraries 
or updates that may be available.
