Make sure to install the litecoin_rpc library:

pip install litecoin_rpc

Now, let's create a basic example for a wallet address tracker using the litecoin_rpc library:

Replace the placeholders with your actual RPC credentials and Litecoin node information. Also, replace the tracked_address with the Litecoin 
address you want to monitor.

This is a basic example, and in a production environment, you might want to handle exceptions, secure the storage of sensitive information, 
and implement a more robust way of sending balance information based on your specific use case. Additionally, keep in mind that frequent queries 
to the Litecoin node may require additional considerations for rate limits and API usage policies.
