The Cardano blockchain typically provides APIs that allow you to interact with it programmatically. In this example, I'll use the requests library to 
make API calls to the Cardano node.

Please make sure to check the latest libraries or tools available for interacting with Cardano, as the blockchain ecosystem can evolve. If a specific 
library called cardano-tools has been released since my last update, you should refer to its documentation for accurate information.

Here's a basic example using the Cardano GraphQL API to track the balance of a specific address:

In this example, replace api_url with the Cardano GraphQL API endpoint and tracked_address with the Cardano address you want to monitor.

Keep in mind that this is a basic example, and you might need to customize it based on your specific requirements and the capabilities of the Cardano node
or API you are connecting to. Additionally, check for any new libraries or tools that may have been released since my last update.
