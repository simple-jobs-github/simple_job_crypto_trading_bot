install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install bitcoinlib
pip install requests

Now, let's create a simple wallet address tracker that requests a public address to be tracked long-term and sends information 
about the wallet balance after every block validation. Note that this is a basic example, and you might want to enhance it based on your specific requirements.

In this example, the WalletAddressTracker class has methods to create a wallet, get the balance of a specific address, 
track the address, and send balance information. You need to replace the placeholder values with your actual wallet name and the address you want to track.

Please note that this is a basic example, and in a production environment, you might want to implement error handling, 
secure storage of sensitive information, and a more robust way of sending balance information based on your specific use case.
