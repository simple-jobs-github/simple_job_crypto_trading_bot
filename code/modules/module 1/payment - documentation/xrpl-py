The xrpl-py library is a Python implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol (Ripple). Ripple uses a different model compared to Bitcoin or Monero. 
It does not have the concept of "blocks" in the same way as other blockchains, and it doesn't use the same mining and validation mechanism.

However, I can provide you with a basic example using xrpl-py to interact with the XRP Ledger and monitor the balance of a specific address. 
Note that XRP uses a decentralized exchange mechanism, and account balances are tracked in a decentralized manner. The XRP Ledger itself doesn't 
have a concept of "blocks" in the traditional blockchain sense.

First, you need to install the xrpl-py library:

pip install xrpl-py

Replace the server_url with the appropriate server URL for either the XRP Ledger testnet or mainnet, and replace tracked_address with the XRP 
address you want to monitor.

Note: This example periodically checks the balance of the specified XRP address. The XRP Ledger itself doesn't have "blocks" in the traditional 
blockchain sense, so the sleep interval may need to be adjusted based on your specific use case. Additionally, replace the placeholder logic in 
send_balance_info with your desired implementation for handling balance information.
