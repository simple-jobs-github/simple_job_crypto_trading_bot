Install the library using:

pip install web3

Now, let's create a basic example for tracking a wallet address and sending information about the wallet balance after every block validation:

Replace the provider_url with your Infura API key or your Ethereum node endpoint. Also, replace the tracked_address with the Ethereum address you want to monitor.

Note: This is a basic example, and in a production environment, you might want to handle exceptions, secure the storage of sensitive information, 
and implement a more robust way of sending balance information based on your specific use case. Additionally, keep in mind that frequent queries 
to the Ethereum node may require additional considerations for rate limits and API usage policies.
