You can use the Polygon (Matic) network APIs to achieve the functionality you described. Please note that libraries and tools in the blockchain 
space can evolve, so you may want to check for the latest developments and libraries.

Here's a basic example using Python and the requests library to query the Polygon network for balance information:

Replace polygon_rpc_url with the correct Polygon RPC endpoint, and tracked_address with the Polygon address you want to monitor.

Keep in mind that the Polygon (Matic) network uses Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC APIs. Always check the official Polygon documentation for any 
updates or changes in the APIs, and ensure that you are using the latest recommended practices for interacting with the Polygon blockchain.
