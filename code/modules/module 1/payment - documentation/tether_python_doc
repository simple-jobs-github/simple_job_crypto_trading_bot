As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I'm not aware of a specific library called tether_python for tracking Tether (USDT) addresses. 
However, I can provide you with a general example using the web3.py library, which is commonly used for interacting with Ethereum-based tokens, 
including Tether.

Please note that my information might be outdated, and you should check for the latest libraries or updates specific to Tether or the 
blockchain network you are working with.

Assuming Tether is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, you can use the following example with web3.py. If Tether has its own 
blockchain or protocol, you may need to use a different library or API specific to that blockchain.

First, install the web3 library:

pip install web3

In this example, replace the provider_url with your Ethereum node or Infura API key, and replace tracked_address with the Tether address 
you want to monitor. Additionally, replace tether_contract_address with the actual Tether contract address, and ensure you have the correct 
ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the Tether contract.

Keep in mind that Tether might have specific APIs or libraries, so you should check the Tether documentation or community for the most 
accurate and up-to-date information.
