the Avalanche blockchain platform does provide APIs that you can use to interact with the network programmatically.

If you're looking to create a wallet address tracker for Avalanche, you might want to use standard web requests to query the Avalanche 
C-Chain (Contract Chain) APIs. Please note that the specific APIs and libraries can evolve, so always refer to the official Avalanche 
documentation for the latest details.

Here's a basic example using Python and the requests library to query the Avalanche C-Chain for balance information:

Replace c_chain_api_url with the correct Avalanche C-Chain API endpoint, and tracked_address with the Avalanche address you want to monitor.

Always check the official Avalanche documentation for any updates or changes in the APIs, and ensure that you are using the latest recommended 
practices for interacting with the Avalanche blockchain.
